# My Laravel Project - How to Run

## 📝 Introduction
Welcome to my Laravel project! This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

## 🛠 Requirements
- **PHP >= 7.4**
- **Composer**
- **MySQL** or any database you prefer

---

## 🚀 Steps to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
First, you need to download the project from GitHub. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
```

### 2️⃣ Go Inside the Folder
After downloading, go inside the project folder:
```bash
cd yourprojectname
```

### 3️⃣ Install Packages
Now you have to download the packages the project needs to work:
```bash
composer install
php artisan config:clear
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up Environment
You'll find a file named `.env.example`. Make a copy of it and rename the copy to `.env`.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and fill in your database info like `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`.

### 5️⃣ Generate Key
Run this command to make a unique key for your project:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 6️⃣ Run Migrations
To set up your database tables, run:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7️⃣ Start the Server
Finally, to see your project in the browser, start the server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Now, open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the Laravel welcome page. Congrats, you did it!

## ❓ Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, check the following:
- Make sure **Composer** and **PHP** are properly installed.
- Check that your database info in `.env` is correct.
- Look at the error messages for clues on what went wrong.

## 🎉 Conclusion
That's it! You should now have the project running on your computer. Enjoy exploring and making it even better!
